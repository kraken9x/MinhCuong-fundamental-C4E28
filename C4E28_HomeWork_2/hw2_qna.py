# -They are used to represent truth values (other values can also be considered
# false or true).

# -A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, 
# workflow or process.

# One conditional can also be nested within another.
# For example, assume we have two integer variables, x and y.
# The following pattern of selection shows how we might decide how they are related to each other.

# Example:

# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")
# else:
#     if x > y:
#         print("x is greater than y")
#     else:
#         print("x and y must be equal")
