1. Why should we use functions at all?

We use functions to factorize the code into a better organized form. We also use function to reuse some blocks of code that we want to reuse.

2. How to define/declare a function?

def <NAME>( <PARAMETERS> ):
    <STATEMENTS>

3. How to call/use a function?

function_name()

4. What is return, why and how do we use it?

- The return statement is followed by an expression. This expression will be evaluated and returned to the caller of calling this function.
- If user don't use the return statement, the program will automate return value = NONE

def <NAME>( <PARAMETERS> ):
    a = <STATEMENTS>
    return a

5. Do we have to use return in every function?

Nope

6. What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it?

arguments/parameters are the input of a function. Functions will take the arguments and use them in a given task and then return a paticular result
def example(x, y):
    a = x - y
    return a
example(1, 2)

7. How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?

1. 
from file_name import function_name
variable = function_name(x, y)

2.
import file_name
variable = file_name.function_name(x.y)
